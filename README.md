## Installation
If you don't already have a place for your scripts, you can create a new directory (e.g. `/bin`, `/scripts`) inside your `HOME` directory and then add the folder to your environment's `PATH` variable

To do that, add the following, into your shell's configuration (e.g. `~/.bashrc`, `~/.zshrc`):

```sh
export PATH=$PATH:~/bin
```
